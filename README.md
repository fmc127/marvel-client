**Planning and Development**

1. User stories and wireframes.
2. Set up back end and used CURL scripts to test CRUD.
3. Added forms to the HTML and set up files for authentication.
4. Once authentication was working, moved on to showing and hiding forms when neccessary.
5. Created handlebars file to create superheros and a partial was made to delete them.
6. Added an enabler to limit users from seeing the delete button on superheros created by other uses.

The opening page will have the 'Superhero Log' title with the 'sign in' and 'sign up' buttons that will be aligned to the left.

Once the user is signed in, the 'change password', 'sign out', 'create a hero', 'update a hero' and 'show heros' button will appear.

Once the 'show heros' button is clicked, the 'clear heros' button will appear. Pressing the 'clear heros' button will remove the list and the 'show heros' button will appear again.

All messages for any buttons clicked will appear above the forms in the top left of the screen.

Once signed back out, the 'change password', 'sign out', 'create a hero', 'update a hero', and 'show heros' buttons will dissappear.
